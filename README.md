Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Html is used to gain style and some function to the user page, JavaScript adds more function and connectivity to the page, and Spa is a faster way for a page to load the page stays the same, but information is updated.


Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Information is easier to understand. Data is easier to store and retrieve.

Functionality
How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JavaScript is a scripting language for webpages and Jason is is a lightweight data-interchange format, Json puts data in a human readable format.


Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
When writing code for edit, update, and add features code was almost the same for each. Have reusable code saves on time and mistakes. If code has an error in on are chances are the same area will be wherever that particular code was used.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Security is used to protect the endpoints of the user. Secret keys allow the users information to stay protection from unauthorized users.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course helped me gain knowledge of full stack development and how not only work with front end but backend production. I still have more to learn but I feel like this was a good starting point.
